## About

Provides high-performance and low-allocating types that work with tabular data represented as delimiter-separated values (DSV). The implementation is based on W3C recommendation "Model for Tabular Data and Metadata on the Web" and can process any conventional tabular data dialect, such as comma-separated values (CSV).

## Key Features

- A general-purpose framework that supports different tabular data dialects and character encodings.
- Provides an extensible record mapping model based on source-generated and custom contracts.
- Includes several extensible field converters for a wide range of commonly used built-in types.
- Compatible with ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation.
