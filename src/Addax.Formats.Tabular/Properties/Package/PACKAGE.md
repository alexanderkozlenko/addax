## About

Provides high-performance and low-allocating types that work with tabular data represented as delimiter-separated values (DSV). The implementation is based on W3C recommendation "Model for Tabular Data and Metadata on the Web" and can process any conventional tabular data dialect, such as comma-separated values (CSV).

## Key Features

- A general-purpose framework that supports different tabular data dialects and character encodings.
- Completely compatible with applications that have native ahead-of-time (AOT) deployment model.
- Offers a customizable and extensible contract model for mapping tabular data to .NET types.
- Includes built-in support for mapping tabular data fields and records to a wide range of common types.
