## About

Provides high-performance and low-allocating types that work with tabular data represented as delimiter-separated values (DSV). The implementation is based on W3C recommendation "Model for Tabular Data and Metadata on the Web" and can process any conventional tabular data dialect, such as comma-separated values (CSV).
